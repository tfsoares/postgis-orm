#### postgis-orm
Micro ORM which allows to automaticaly produce forms based on geotables field types

### Description
This is a part of a bigger project. The amount of geotables I had to organize and support led me to trying to create somekind of semi-automatic process.

Since this was a solution to an specific application it is as simple as possible, allowing only tables whose name begin with 'pt_'.

### Todo
* Validation
* Translation tables
